# Understanding JavaScript
> Code sources and commented description

Through this repository I'll store my studies content relative to JavaScript. So it's possible to find the different topics organized in folders with code examples.
Feel free if you want to help complete the subject adding anything here or have a suggestion to improve the method of presenting information. 

## Usage

All examples are organized in  order of better understanding, so starting from the basics of error handling to Async/await. Make sure that you have Node.js installed and just run `node <dir>/<file>` to run the examples.

> Some examples have commented explanation and code within them, so you might want try uncommenting them and checking out different parts of the code.
